# Development Information and Instructions

## Getting Started

### Development Dependencies  

The primary tool used for building and running this repository is [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

Some tasks may require the usage of a local [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) installation, but we hope to remove that in the future.

For Windows users:
You can install Docker Desktop from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
When running on Windows, you'll need to ensure the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is installed and updated to WSL version 2. To do this:
1. Open a Powershell windows as administrator
2. Install WSL and a Linux distribution. To install Ubuntu 22.04:
    `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`
3. To make sure WSL is updated to WSL 2:
    `wsl --update`
4. Then make sure Docker Desktop sees the installed WSL and Linux distribution. In Docker Desktop's Settings | Resources | WSL integration, make sure the Ubuntu 22.04 distribution is enabled. You may need to hit Refresh and wait a minute or two for it to show. Once enabled, hit Apply & Restart to restart the Docker engine.

### Building and Running the app (dev mode)

<!-- todo: update when hot-reloading actually works -->
1. Ensure `docker` is installed.
2. `docker compose up --build --wait` at the root of the repository.
3. Make a request to the app (`curl` or in a browser): `localhost:3000`.
4. `docker compose down` to stop the app.

### Debugging the app

You can use Visual Studio Code or other tools to debug when developing locally with the Docker container. See the [next.js debugging configuration instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/debugging) for setup details.

### Viewing container logs

1. Start the app (see above).
2. `docker compose logs` at the root of the repository. (Add `-f` at the end to stream the logs)

### Enabling "hot reloading"

1. Ensure `experimental docker features` are enabled
   1. Open the docker dashboard UI
   2. Ensure you have >= v4.19.0 (bottom-left of window)
   3. Settings (gear in top-right) -> "Features in development" -> "Experimental features" -> ensure "Access experimental features" is checked.
   4. "Apply and restart"
2. Start the app (see above).
3. `docker compose alpha watch` at the root of the repository.
4. Any saved changes to `src/`, `public/`, or `package.json` should be reflected in the running application.

> note: this uses a docker feature currently in alpha, which may change without notice. If this stops working, please notify the maintainers of this repository so that we can make any needed changes.

<!-- Note to maintainers: In the event that this stops working, we will likely want to switch to volume bind-mounting the relevant files. That comes with a potential sync performance tradeoff on macOS. -->

### Execute commands inside the container

If you need to execute a command inside the application's environment (such as for debugging):
1. Start the app (see above).
2. `docker compose exec frontend /bin/sh` at the root of the repository.

### Running the app locally outside of Docker

We encourage contributors to use Docker if possible to keep the build and runtime clean and prevent issues that come up with differing local setups. However, if there's a need to build and run locally, this project can be built as a standard next.js / TypeScript project. From the root of the checkout:

1. Run `npx next build` to compile and build the project. Make sure to resolve any errors.
2. Run `npx serve@latest out` to run the Next.js project using the default server.

### Running the linter locally

This repository uses github's Super Linter and we encourage running the linter
against your changes before making a pull request to dev or main.
You can run this locally using Docker using the supplied `super-linter.env` collection of environment variables
and your own:

1. Obtain the Super Linter Docker container:

    `docker pull github/super-linter:latest`

2. Invoke Docker to run the Super Linter against your project directory with the included environment variables:

    `docker run --env-file super-linter.env -v [path-to-project]:/tmp/lint github/super-linter`

Where [path-to-project] is the path to your project. This can be a full or relative path.
For example, if you're currently in the top level project-ricotta directory you can run the linter with:

    `docker run --env-file super-linter.env -v .:/tmp/lint github/super-linter`

To narrow the files to lint, pass the file(s) to run as a regular expression in the environment variable
`FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE`. To exclude file(s) pass an appropriate addition to the
regular expression in the FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE environment variable entry in the `super-linter.env` file
or supply the regular expression for the files you wish to include on the command-line with the `-e` flag.

For example, to only lint the file DEVELOPMENT.md in the top level directory:

   `docker run --env-file super-linter.env -e FILTER_REGEX_INCLUDE=DEVELOPMENT.md -v .:/tmp/lint github/super-linter`

Use UNIX-style paths with forward-slash \/ characters as path separators.
See the [super-linter GitHub repository](https://github.com/github/super-linter/blob/main/README.md#filter-linted-files)
for more information on how to specify files for super-linter runs.
