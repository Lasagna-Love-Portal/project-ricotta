# Architecture

The following document outlines the cloud architecture for Project Ricotta.

## Design Principles

Principles that guide the architecture include:

* Simplicity: Complexity increases fragility and makes contribution more difficult.
* Cost-effectiveness: As this project supports a non-profit institution, we must make the most of our resources.
* Scalability: The architecture should be able to scale to meet the needs of the project during peak demand.
* Security: Implementing principle of least privilege, RBAC, secure defaults, separation of concerns, and defense in depth, we design a system that is secure by design.
